## ☁️ Hosting & Deployment
This portfolio is **hosted on AWS S3** as a static website and **routed through AWS Route 53** to allow access via a custom domain.

### **How I Set It Up:**
1. **Uploaded the website files to an AWS S3 bucket**.
2. **Configured S3 bucket for static website hosting** (public access enabled, index document set to `index.html`).
3. **Set up a custom domain** with **AWS Route 53** (domain purchased & DNS records configured).
4. Used **AWS Certificate Manager (ACM)** for HTTPS support.
5. Set up **CloudFront** for caching and performance optimization.
